Xtherma-Rest-API v0.1 documentation


## Xtherma-Rest-API is a restful API. 
It is read-only for now.
The endpoints accessible are temporary and prone to change. 
If you would like a specific setting exposed in the API please tell us via info [at] xtherma.de


## Authentification
Authentification is currently done via bearer token. 
Authentification via oAuth2 is under development and will be available shortly.
A Fernportal-User with a heat pump assigned is needed to access data. 

## Getting your access token
Go to your user profile by clicking the grey user icon in the top right of the fernportal and scroll to the bottom to retrieve your access token. 

## Getting data
Individual heat pumps are identified by their Fernportal-S/N. 
You can find your Fernportal-S/N on fernportal.xtherma.de
on the overview tab under "Ger채t" -> "SN-Fernportal-Modul".

There are many ways to fetch data from the API. Here is an example using curl:

curl -H "Authorization: Bearer YOUR_TOKEN_HERE" https://fernportal.xtherma.de/api/device/FP-YOUR_FP_NUM

The response will look like this:

```
{
    "serial_number": "FP-YOUR_FP_NUM",
    "data": [
		{
            "name": "Betriebsmodus",
            "value": 1,
            "min": "",
            "max": "",
            "mapping": "Standby,Heizbetrieb, K체hlbetrieb,Warmwasser,Automatik",
            "unit": "",
            "output_factor": "",
            "input_factor": ""
        }
    ]
}
```

### name
This is the name of the setting. It is the same as on Fernportal

### value
This is the value of the setting. These values are always standard 16-bit unsigned INT. 
If you expect a signed value, e.g. for a temperature you have to sign them yourself.

### min
This is the minimal value of "value". If it is empty it default to 0.

### max 
This is the max value of "value". If it is empty it defaults to 65335.

### mapping
This is a comma separated list of strings that further describe "value".
In this example "Betriebsmodus" can be 0 = Standby, 1 = Heizbetrieb, 2 = K체hlbetrieb ...

### unit
If "value" is a numerical value, unit contains the unit as a string e.g. "째C", "K" and so on 

### output_factor
not used right now

### input_factor
this field contains a mathematical instruction for value as a string. "/10" means you have to divide by 10 to get the real value.
